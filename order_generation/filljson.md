Locate the purchase‑order (PO) file(s) whose SKU matches each JSON filename (look in order_generation/orders/).

Using the PO, manually fill every field in the JSON template. Do not add, remove, or rename keys; keep the structure exactly the same.

If the PO contains product images, copy each image into /image/<SKU>/ (create the folder named exactly after the SKU).

When copying the product‑description text, preserve any bold text, highlights, and font‑color formatting found in the PO.

If you cannot find a matching PO, fill the template with the most reasonable information you can infer and continue; never abort the process.
